Some possible things to use in my shiny app

http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/faq/smooths.htm

smoothing example at end of this article shows all 4 smooths at once
https://plot.ly/ggplot2/geom_smooth/ and note it is using plotly. plotly can work with shiny too. https://plot.ly/r/shiny-tutorial/
And you can get pretty crazy with applying different smooths in one graph. http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/110380/smoother-lines-for-ggplot2

1) I can move a slider to choose types of fit: linear, locally weighted, linear/quadratic, second order polynomial
2) And perhaps offer 2 or 3 different data set choices
3) Use levels from 3rd variable to fit separate smooths. Choice of more than one variable?

The point is that the shiny app allows interactive use of different smooths to learn how they may or may not fit the data. As the end of this blog article states, 'using smooths makes it easy to see overall trends and explore visually how different models fit the data.'

2 is done. bit of trouble with switch returning all 3 args to the ggplot function. used List() + aes_string() to pass all parameters into ggplot

Still have to select a proper group of datasets for scatterplot and smooth

Some possible things to use in my shiny app

http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/faq/smooths.htm
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient
smoothing example at end of this article shows all 4 smooths at once
https://plot.ly/ggplot2/geom_smooth/ and note it is using plotly. plotly can work with shiny too. https://plot.ly/r/shiny-tutorial/
And you can get pretty crazy with applying different smooths in one graph. http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/110380/smoother-lines-for-ggplot2

1) I can move a slider to choose types of fit: linear, locally weighted, linear/quadratic, second order polynomial
2) And perhaps offer 2 or 3 different data set choices
3) Use levels from 3rd variable to fit separate smooths. Choice of more than one variable?

The point is that the shiny app allows interactive use of different smooths to learn how they may or may not fit the data. As the end of this blog article states, 'using smooths makes it easy to see overall trends and explore visually how different models fit the data.'

2 is done. bit of trouble with switch returning all 3 args to the ggplot function. used List() + aes_string() to pass all parameters into ggplot

Still have to select a proper group of datasets for scatterplot and smooth


A wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatterplot_smoothing says:
In statistics, several scatterplot smoothing methods are available to fit a function through the points of a scatterplot to best represent the relationship between the variables.
Scatterplots may be smoothed by fitting a line to the data points in a diagram. This line attempts to display the non-random component of the association between the variables in a 2D scatter plot. Smoothing attempts to separate the non-random behaviour in the data from the random fluctuations, removing or reducing these fluctuations, and allows prediction of the response based value of the explanatory variable.
Smoothing is normally accomplished by using any one of the techniques mentioned below.

1-13-16: added a couple of small embellishments including descriptive text about dataset under the plot and some basic directions in the side panel.
My simple smooth selection technique is not really that relevant with most of the datasets
In many cases it would probably be more appropriate to modify the 'formula' argument
In a couple of cases, a third variable could be used for aes:color argument and then more than 1 fit would be obtained. Sex for heightweight is a good place to use this.
